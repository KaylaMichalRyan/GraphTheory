\begin{abstract}
        For any graph G it is possible to describe each of its vertices uniquely with respect to an ordered subset of vertices of G called a resolving set.
    In this project, we investigate properties of associated with minimal resolving sets, known as bases and conditions under which changing G affects its bases.

\section{introduction}

    %The basics of what you're doing: relevant tools, defs techniques etc%
    For this investigation we will begin with several basic defintions that might not be part of a typical introduction to graph theory.

 \begin{defin}[Representation of vertex(with respect to W)]:\\
    For an ordered subset $W=(w_1, w_2, ..., w_i, w_{i+1}, ...)$ of vertices in $G$, the representation of a vertex $v \in G$ with respect to $W$ denoted $rep(v/W)$ is: \\
  $rep(v/W)=(d(v,w_1), d(v,w_2), ..., d(v,w_i), d(v,w_{i+1}), ... )$
 \end{defin}
    
 \begin{defin}[Resolving Set]:\\
  An ordered subset $W \subset V(G)$ is called a resolving set of G if\\ $\forall v_1, v_2 \in V(G)$  , $rep(v_1/W) \neq  rep(v_2/W)$.
 \end{defin}
 
 \begin{defin}[Basis of a graph]:\\
  A resolving set $W$ of $G$ is called a $basis\ of\ G$.
 \end{defin}
 
 \begin{defin}[Metric Dimension]:\\
  The metric dimension of a graph $G$ is the order of any basis for $G$.
 \end{defin}


Finding the metric dimension or any basis for a graph is currently considered to be an NP-Hard problem. 
Metric dimension is known for some subsets of graphs which will be discussed later, but in general it is very difficult or simply time consuming to determine.
The intent of this paper is to investigate whether there is a set of graphs for which having a known metric dimension allows us to determine metric dimension after adding or removing an edge.
Furthermore we will attempt to investigate what properties of these graphs make it possible to determine metric dimension for them after adding or removing an edge.
\begin{ex}
 The path graph $P_3$ has a metric dimension of 1. Simply calling $W$ the set containing one leaf node of $P_3$ is sufficient to construct a basis for $P_3$.
 By adding any edge to $P_3$, $P_3$ becomes $K_3$ which has a metric dimension of 2.

  \node[main node] (1) {};
  \node[main node] (2) [right of=1] {};
  \node[main node] (3) [above of=2] {};

\section{encodability of graphs with respect to their bases}
  \begin{defin}[Representation set of a graph]:\\
  The representation set of a graph with respect to a basis $W$ is the set $H=\{r(v/W)\mid v\in G\}$.   
  \end{defin}

  \begin{defin}[Unique Encoding]:\\
   If we can construct a graph $G$ from its representation set $H$ by connecting vertices in $G$ 
   if their representations differ by no more than 1 in each place then we say that $G$ is uniquely encoded by $H$.
   Furthermore we say that $G$ is uniquely encodeable with respect to its basis $W$ or $G$ is enccodable under $W$.
  \end{defin}

\begin{lem}
$G$ is encodable under $W$ if and only if $\ \forall$ nonadjacent $\ v_1,\ v_2\in G$:\\
$\ \exists\ w \in W$ s.t. $\left| d(v_1,w)-d(v_2,w)\right| > 1$ 
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that we construct a graph $G$ and basis $W$
\end{proof}

\section{Upper and Lower Bounds on Metric Dimension}

\begin{lem}
 let $G$ be a unicyclic graph. Let $L$ be the cycle in $G$. Let $H = G-L$ then metric dimension of $G \leq$ metric dimension of $MD(H)\-$
\end{lem}


\begin{lem}
 Let $G$ be a graph with a bridge $(u,v)$ s.t. $G-(u,v)$ has components $H_1, H_2$ such that $H_1$ 
 has at least one degree $>$ 2 vertex. Then for any basis $W$ of $G$, $W\nsubseteq H_2$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}
 Let $G$ be a graph with a cut vertex $v$ and basis $W$. If $deg(v)>2$ or if for two components $H_1, H_2$ of $G-v$,
 $H_1$ has a vertex of degree $>$ 2, $W\nsubseteq H_2$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 Suppose that $W \subset H$. 
 Let $v$ be a cut vertex of $G$ s.t. $G-v$ has more than 2 components. Since $W \subset H$, the path from any vertex not in $H$ to any element of $W$ must pass through $v$.
 Then there exist vertices $u_1,\ u_2$ adjacent to $v$ such that $d(u_1, w_i) = d(u_2, w_i) = d(v, w_i) + 1$ for all $w_i \in W$.
 In this case, $r(u_1/W) = r(u_2/W)$. Then $W$ is not a resolving set for $G$, by contradiction $W \nsubseteq H$.\\
 We can show without loss of generality that the same is true for any cut vertex $v$ whenever some component of $G-v$ other than $H$ is not path.\\
 Observe that if $G$ is not a path it contains at least one $deg > 2$ vertex. 
 Let $l$ be a $deg > 2$ vertex in $G$ s.t. $\forall u_i$ s.t. $deg(u_i)>2, d(u_i, v) \greq d(l)$ 
 \end{proof}

\begin{lem}
 Let $G$ be any graph. Let $H$ be the graph obtained by edge contractions on $G$. 
 If only the number of degree 2 vertices is changed, 
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 
\end{proof}
