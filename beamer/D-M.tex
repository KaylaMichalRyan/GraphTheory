\title[Dushnik-Miller Embeddings and some Limitations] % (optional, use only with long paper titles)
{An Introduction to Poset Dimensions}


\author[McGuire] % (optional, use only with lots of authors)
{Trevor McGuire}
% - Give the names in the same order as the appear in the paper.
% - Use the \inst{?} command only if the authors have different
%   affiliation.

\institute[NDSU] % (optional, but mostly needed)
{
  %
  Department of Mathematics\\
  North Dakota State University\\
  Fargo, ND}
  
% - Use the \inst command only if there are several affiliations.
% - Keep it simple, no one is interested in your street address.

\date[AMS2007] % (optional, should be abbreviation of conference name)
{Combinatorics Seminar, NDSU, September 2015}
% - Either use conference name or its abbreviation.
% - Not really informative to the audience, more for people (including
%   yourself) who are reading the slides online

 



% If you have a file called "university-logo-filename.xxx", where xxx

% \logo{\pgfuseimage{university-logo}}



% Delete this, if you do not want the table of contents to pop up at

% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.
